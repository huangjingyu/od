Job Description
Here's a list of 800 podcasts: http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_directory.php?type=title&value=all. 
I need the following items extracted from this page:
1) Title of each feed
2) Provider
3) RSS feed URL of each feed. If you click into the link on each Title, 
there should be a link to the XML file of the RSS feed (see the orange POD icon). I need this URL
4) most recent PubDate. If you view the source of the RSS feed XML, 
you will see a <pubDate> field. I need the first (most recent) date. If there is no <pubDate> field, please extract the <lastBuildDate>.

You should be able to write a script to scrape the page and extract each field. 
There is some trickiness because some feeds require clicking on another link to reach the RSS feed URL (the one in XML format), 
so you have to make sure that you reach the page that gives the PubDate.

As an output, please send me an Excel spreadsheet with each feed as a separate row and the columns are Title, 
Provider, RSS Feed URL, and Most Recent Publication/Build Date.

For example, the first one should be "Poverty with a View", "KNAU", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/knaupodcast", "Thu, 21 Apr 2011 20:40:57 PDT".

This task must be completed by no later than 12:00pm Pacific time on Tuesday, February 7 in order to receive positive feedback. Thanks!
